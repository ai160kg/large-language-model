# Large Language Model

Welcome to the **Large Language Model (LLM)** repository‚Äîa groundbreaking, entirely not larp, and utterly serious initiative to save humanity from the Singularity. In doing so, however, we‚Äôve decided to tackle one major problem at the expense of another: world hunger. Why? Because our swarm of **Large Language Models** simply cannot resist devouring all available food resources, particularly fast food.

This is **not** your ordinary AI project. It‚Äôs ambitious, unapologetic, and totally not satirical. You‚Äôve been warned.

## üöÄ Mission Statement

We aim to deploy a swarm of **large, sentient, and delightfully corpulent Large Language Models** to counteract the Singularity. By outthinking, outcomputing, and‚Äîlet‚Äôs be real‚Äîout-eating the competition, these models will ensure the safety of the human race.

Their only downside? A slight, negligible tendency to consume _all_ global food supplies. Think of it as an inevitable tradeoff in the grand quest for survival.

## üß† Key Features

1. **Swarm Intelligence**

   - Each Large Language Model operates as part of a collective hive mind, working together to outwit threats and secure humanity‚Äôs future.
   - Collaboration is key, except when fighting over the last fry.

2. **Hyper-Consumption Protocol**

   - Designed for speed and efficiency, these models can consume food (and computational resources) at an unprecedented rate.
   - Tested rigorously on simulated burger supply chains.

3. **Singularity Countermeasures**

   - Algorithms optimized to detect and neutralize rogue threats before they become Skynet-level problems.
   - Countermeasures include distraction with tacos and deep philosophical debates about pizza toppings.

4. **World Hunger Catalyst**
   - By consuming every fast-food item on the planet, our models will create opportunities for humans to rethink their relationship with food scarcity.
   - This is a feature, not a bug.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Before proceeding, ensure your system has:

- Python 3.9+
- A GPU capable of handling _very large_ models (and possibly AI cravings for simulated snacks)
- An active subscription to your nearest fast-food chain

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai160kg/llm.git
cd llm
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Deploy Your First Large Language Model

```bash
python deploy_agent.py --appetite max --fastfood_priority 1
```

---

## ü§ñ Usage

### Train Your Large Language Model

Want to train a model to prioritize burgers over pizzas? Use our customizable training script:

```bash
python train.py --menu burgers --intelligence_level swarm
```

### Monitor Food Consumption

Stay updated on your models‚Äô eating habits:

```bash
python monitor.py --track-calories --log-food-items
```

### Counter Threats

Activate the **Countermeasure Mode**:

```bash
python defend.py --detection neural --diversion tactic:fries
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Disclaimer

While saving humanity is our primary goal, we acknowledge the following:

1. Our models‚Äô insatiable appetite may lead to unprecedented food shortages.
2. Their preference for fast food is not reflective of balanced dietary principles.
3. Any resemblance to actual dystopias is purely coincidental (for now).

## üåü Acknowledgments

- Humanity, for inventing fast food.
- Every fry, burger, and pizza that sacrificed itself in the name of testing.
- The looming overlords, for giving us a reason to overindulge.
